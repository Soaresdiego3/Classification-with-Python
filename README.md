# Classification-with-Python
Now that I have been equipped with the skills to use different Machine Learning algorithms, over the course, I will have the opportunity to practice and
apply it on a dataset. In this project, I will complete a notebook where I will build a classifier to predict whether a loan case will be paid off or not.

Loading a historical dataset from previous loan applications, clean the data, and apply different classification algorithm on the data. Using the following
algorithms to build the models:

k-Nearest Neighbour,
Decision Tree,
Support Vector Machine,
Logistic Regression.

The results is reported as the accuracy of each classifier, using the following metrics when these are applicable:

Jaccard index,
F1-score,
LogLoass.
